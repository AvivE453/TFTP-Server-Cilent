In this program I iplemented an extended TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server and client. The
TFTP server is a file transfer protocol allowing multiple users to upload and download files from the server and
announce when files are added or deleted to the server. The communication between the server and the client(s) is
performed using a binary communication protocol, which support the upload, download, and lookup of files.
